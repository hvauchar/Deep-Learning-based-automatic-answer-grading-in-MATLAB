# Deep-Learning-based-automatic-answer-grading-in-MATLAB
This project presents a system for descriptive answer checking and grading application based on natural language processing and deep learning. The system is based on Bidirectional LSTM and word embedding to learn features of text using word encoding and trained them via Truncated Backpropagation(TBP)
